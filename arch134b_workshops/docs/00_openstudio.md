If you want to conduct all of your energy performance simulations in the OpenStudio software itself and need the OSM file, here is a direct way to obtain it through Grasshopper environment. You'll still need your specific weather file, Rhino and Pollination downloaded as referenced in [module 3](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_shoebox.html#shoebox-model).
