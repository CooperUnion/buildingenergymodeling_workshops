# Shoebox Model

A shoebox model is a simplified, usually rectangular building used for pre-design to early design performance evaluation. With a simplified model, you can adjust different architectural parameters, e.g. windows size, constructions orientation, to understand how the performance changes with these adjustments. In this tutorial, we will model a single family home in Rhino and perform an ideal air load simulation using Ladybug Tools. 

## Rhino
1. Install Rhino8 with Grasshopper: <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/download/" target="_blank">here</a>

## Pollination Grasshopper Plugin for simulation 
2. Install <a href="https://app.pollination.solutions/cad-plugins" target="_blank">here</a>

## Inkscape for visualization
3. Install Inkscape==1.4 <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.4/" target="_blank">here</a> for graphics editing.
