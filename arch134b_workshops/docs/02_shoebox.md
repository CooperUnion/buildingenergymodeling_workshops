# Shoebox Model

A shoebox model is a simplified, usually rectangular building used for pre-design to early design performance evaluation. With a simplified model, you can adjust different architectural parameters, e.g. windows size, constructions orientation, to understand how the performance changes with these adjustments. In this tutorial, we will model a single family home in Rhino and perform an ideal air load simulation using Ladybug Tools. 

## Rhino for 3d modeling
1. Install Rhino8 with Grasshopper: <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/download/" target="_blank">here</a>

## Case Study Files
Download the single family home Rhino model from the github: <a href="https://github.com/gaudi369/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/blob/main/arch134b_workshops/_downloads/single_family.3dm" target="_blank">here</a>

Download the weather files folder from Github: <a href="https://github.com/gaudi369/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/tree/main/arch134b_workshops/_downloads/USA_CA_Van.Nuys.AP.722886_TMYx" target="_blank">here</a>
     
## Pollination Grasshopper Plugin for simulation 
2. Install Pollination for Grasshopper: <a href="https://app.pollination.solutions/cad-plugins" target="_blank">here</a>
