# Shoebox Model

A shoebox model is a simplified, usually rectangular building used for pre-design to early design performance evaluation. With a simplified model, you can adjust different architectural parameters, e.g. windows size, constructions orientation, to understand how the performance changes with these adjustments. In this tutorial, we will model a single family home in Rhino and perform an ideal air load simulation using Ladybug Tools. 

## Rhino
1. Install Rhino8 with Grasshopper

Download the single family home model here:
   *   :download:`Single Family Home Rhino Model <../_downloads/single_family.3dm>`
     
## Ladybug Tools Suite for simulation and GIMP and Inkscape for visualization
