# Energy Simulation to Estimate Heating and Cooling Loads

Heating and cooling loads are the amount of heat energy that needs to be added to or removed from a space to maintain a desired indoor temperature. These values are crucial for determining the size of your HVAC system. 

Energy Use Intensity is a measure of how much energy a building uses relative to its size. Heating and cooling are often the main energy consumers but all loads are considered for this calculation. In general, lower EUI means a "more energy efficient" building.
