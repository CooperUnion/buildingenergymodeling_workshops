# Multi-Zone Model Analysis (Amber Sun)

## Case Study File
Download the new Rhino file for the single family with garage: <a href="https://github.com/gaudi369/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/blob/docs/arch134b_workshops/_downloads/single_family_shed.3dm" target="_blank">here</a> 

## Reference Starting Point
Check the reference image for what this should look like:
```{image} ../_static/multizone/multizone1_1.png

```
<br/><br/>

This should be your Grasshopper after completing module 6. In module 7, we will be getting a feel of multi-zone energy modeling by adding another room/zone: a garage.
