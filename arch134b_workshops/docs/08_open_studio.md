# Direct Conversion from Rhino to OpenStudio
If you want to conduct all of your energy performance simulations in the OpenStudio software itself and need the OSM file, here is a direct way to obtain it through Grasshopper environment.



## Components Used
Geometry ([3.6.2](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_2_shoebox_p2.html#create-a-geometry-component)), HB Room from Solid, HB Model, HB Model to OSM, Panel ([3.5.2](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_2_shoebox_p2.html#create-a-geometry-component))

## Conversion Breakdown
1. Download Rhino8 and then Pollination as referenced in [module 2](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_shoebox.html). Find your weather file as shown in [1.3.1](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/01_1_climate_p1.html#get-weather-file).
2. Open your model in the Rhino application. Open Grasshopper like in [2.5.1](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_1_shoebox_p1.html#open-grasshopper-from-rhino-by-clicking-the-circled-green-icon).
3. Recreate the components as shown in the image below.
