## Components Used
Geometry [3.6.2](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_2_shoebox_p2.html#create-a-geometry-component)
HB Room from Solid 
HB Model
HB Model to OSM
Panel [3.5.2](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_2_shoebox_p2.html#create-a-geometry-component)

## Conversion Breakdown
1. Download Rhino and then Pollination as referenced in [module 3](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/02_shoebox.html#shoebox-model). Find your weather file as shown in [2.3.1](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/01_climate.html#where-can-i-find-weather-files).
