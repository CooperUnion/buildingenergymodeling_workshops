# Building Energy Modeling Workshops (Rhino & Ladybug Tools Edition 2025)

This tutorial teaches using a plug-in in Rhino called _Grasshopper_, a visual programming environment that is useful for mapping out complex algorithmic systems or simple utility components. Another environmental performance analysis plugin is ClimateStudio, which is standalone and more compatible with Rhino than the OpenStudio software that requires additional workflows to conduct energy modeling.
