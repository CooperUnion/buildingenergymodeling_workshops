# Building Energy Modeling Workshops (Rhino & Ladybug Tools Edition 2025)

This tutorial introduces _Grasshopper_, a plug-in for Rhino that provides a visual programming environment useful for creating simple processes or complex algorithmic systems.

Another possible tool is _ClimateStudio_, an environmental performance analysis plugin that integrates more seamlessly with Rhino than OpenStudio, which requires additional workflows for conducting energy modeling.

If you wish to convert your Rhino model to an OSM file to directly open in OpenStudio software itself, jump to [module 8](https://cooperunion.github.io/buildingenergymodeling_workshops/docs/08_open_studio.html#direct-conversion-from-rhino-to-openstudio). For an OpenStudio workshop, check out Kian Wee Chen's [course Arch134B](https://chenkianwee.github.io/arch134b_workshops/docs/intro.html).
