# Building Energy Modeling Workshops (Rhino & Ladybug Tools Edition 2025)

This tutorial introduces _Grasshopper_, a plug-in for Rhino that provides a visual programming environment useful for creating simple processes or complex algorithmic systems.

Another possible tool is _ClimateStudio_, an environmental performance analysis plugin that integrates more seamlessly with Rhino than OpenStudio, which requires additional workflows for conducting energy modeling.
